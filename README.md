# About

This Repo is part of a excercise for the REACT Udacity Nanodegree. It implements a Book Search App which is forked from [Udacity Boylerplate](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

The App loads Books from a Backend server. You can change Books between the different shelfs and also add new Books through the Search Page.

On the Search Page you have a type as you go seach bar. If your search query is matching you will see the results. You can move Books to yuor shelfs from here. If you have a book already one one of your shelfs you will have that already selected.

Give it a shot.
